# msvpvf-c
C/C++ port of msvpvf

## What is this??
msvpvf is a tool used to "downgrade" VEGAS Pro project files, written entirely in C.

Currently, it doesn't look that great. Making pretty apps with `windows.h` is not the easiest job in the world. If someone is willing enough to make it look prettier, be my guest.

## Compilation
```
git clone https://github.com/mrpapersonic/msvpvf-c
cd msvpvf-c
make
```
NOTE: if you are using Windows, there is a GUI available. To compile it, use `make gui`.
